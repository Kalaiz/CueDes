## ✍️ Reflection

- Package organisation - went with Packaging via feature after having a skim through [this](https://proandroiddev.com/package-by-type-by-layer-by-feature-vs-package-by-layered-feature-e59921a4dffa).
- Learned a few things about styles and themes. I learned it for the SwitchCompat, and made it such that it is red when unchecked and green when checked. 
- Tried to reduce redundant layout code for tabitem by using <include> however <include> only overwrite layout based attributes. Based on the [tabitem documentation.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38035415/11200630), 3 attributes are provided for TabItem and they can be used alongside with the layout declaration.
- One of the SwitchCompat was white in color despite applying a themeoverlay. A [unresolved SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59086466/after-migration-to-androidx-switchcompat-is-white) states that the OP had a similar issue as well. I made the MainActivity extend AppCompactActivity instead to overcome this problem.
- Learned about constraint weight, which help me achieve layout suitable for different device size. I faced a challenge in which i needed to place an image with a width of 1/3rd the screen width. I wanted to do this declaritively instead of programmatically. I eventually managed to do this by having a linear layout within which i placed the image alongside with a void ( used view instead of space as space is deprecated) 
- In order to hide my Google Map SDK API key, I had to encapsulate key in a gradle property file and then acccess it via meta data created by the app level gradle build. By default, the repo will not contain the API key, thus affecting the installation APK. In order to overcome this, I un-ignored the apk file created in gitignore and have linked it in the Installation instruction.
- Got to know about the existence of bottomNavigationView, although I had already achieved a similar result using a tablayout.I changed it to a BottomNavigationView as it allow the [bar can disappear on scroll, based on HideBottomViewOnScrollBehavior, when it is placed within a CoordinatorLayout and one of the children within the CoordinatorLayout is scrolled](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/bottomnavigation/BottomNavigationView). 
- I had to make sure the application rings an alarm even when the user is not interacting with the application. This seemed like a long running task  which  1) constantly check the location 2) use that location to check whether it is going to cause an alarm. I went with [Services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services) in order to achieve this. I also needed to gain information about the location so that the application is informed as well and hence went with a bound service. By making it a bound service, the service will run as long 
- I was going with MVVM architecture, however I was confused on which level would Services would be placed.[TODO]
- The default positioning of the current location button is being overlapped by my `SearchView`. In order to overcome this, I tried a [recomendation](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43971145/11200630) of setting padding, however, this makes the location to be at a offset from the center of the screen. I also tried to [manually set](https://stackoverflow.com/a/48277931/11200630) the `LayoutParams` of the button, howvever, upon clicking it, nothing happens. Eventually, I made my own current location button using `FusedClientLocation` API and used `animateCamera` and `CameraUpdate` in accordance.
- Learned that [`Shape`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50619479/11200630) s/ [`ShapeDrawable`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/graphics/drawables#shape-drawable) s can be applied to a `View`'s background, so to make the `View` of the relevant shape, while attempting to get rounded corners for my `BottomSheetDialogFragment`.
- I have used Fragments which uses the same container, in `selection`. Fragments sharing the same container will have to replace one another or else they will overlap each other.To avoid this, I simply hide the previous fragment and show the relevant fragment upon `popBackStack`.
- While implementing the `OnBoardFragment`, I wanted to access the page indication `View` so to disable it when the user has'nt given relevant permission. However, the `OnBoardFragment`,which  extends [`OnboardingSupportFragment()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/leanback/app/OnboardingSupportFragment), has limited accessibility to all of it's `View`. In order to overcome this, I dug into the `@style/Theme.AppCompat.Leanback.Onboarding` and tried to see possible `View ID` for the page indication `View`, and found that `androidx.leanback.R.id.page_indicator` to be the suitable one.
