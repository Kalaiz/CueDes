### üîñ References:
- Learned a gradle way to hide API key from this [google codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform-101-android#3).
- [Google Map ApiDemos repository](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/lite) by Google; Although some parts were obsolete, it gave me gotchas on the usage of the API alongside with `ViewGroup`s such as `RecyclerView`.
- ~~XML style for making `BottomSheetDialog` have rounded corners is adapted from this SO [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50619479/11200630).~~
- ~~Prevented the dismissal of `BottomSheetDialogFragment` upon touching outside/pulling it down via this [method](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50734566/11200630).~~
- Used a Custom ViewPager2 Transition  via this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59235979/11200630). 
- ~~Expanding `BottomSheetDialogFragment` to a custom height was done with the help of this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/58067230/11200630)~~
