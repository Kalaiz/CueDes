### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used:
 - ViewPager2,TabLayout,FragmentStateAdapter,Co-ordinator,Constraint,Linear Layout, Spinner,
 - Kotlin
 - viewbinding

### ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection:
Challenges 
- Package organisation - went with Packaging via feature after having a skim through [this](https://proandroiddev.com/package-by-type-by-layer-by-feature-vs-package-by-layered-feature-e59921a4dffa).

- Learned a few things about styles and themes Learned it for the SwitchCompat. 
- Tried to reduce redundant layout code for tabitem by using <include> however <include> only overwrite layout based attributes. Based on the [tabitem documentation.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38035415/11200630), 3 attributes are provided for TabItem and they can be used alongside with the layout declaration.
- One of the SwitchCompat was white in color dewspite applying a theme. A [SO post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59086466/after-migration-to-androidx-switchcompat-is-white) states that the OP had a similar issue as well. I made the MainActivity extend AppCompactActivity instead to overcome this problem.
- Learned about constraint weight, which help me achieve layout suitable for different device size. I faced a challenge in which i needed to place an image with a width of 1/3rd the screen width. I wanted to do this declaritively instead of programmatically. I eventually managed to do this by having a linear layout within which i placed the image alongside with a void ( used view instead of space as space is deprecated) 
- In order to hide my Google Map SDK API key, I had to encapsulate key in a gradle property file and then acccess it via meta data created by the app level gradle build. By default, the repo will not contain the API key, thus affecting the installation APK. In order to overcome this, I un-ignored the apk file created  in gitignore and have linked it in the Installation instruction.
### üîñ References:
Learned a gradle way to hide API key from this [google codelab](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/maps-platform-101-android#3)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation:
Note: It will be easier to do the following via a phone. 
1) Install the [APK](/app/build/debug/apk-debug.apk).
2) Allow App Installations from Unknown Sources, if requested.
