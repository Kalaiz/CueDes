### ✍️ Reflection:
Challenges - Package organisation - went with Packaging via feature after having a skim through [this](https://proandroiddev.com/package-by-type-by-layer-by-feature-vs-package-by-layered-feature-e59921a4dffa).

- Learned a few things about styles and themes Learned it for the SwitchCompat. 
- Tried to reduce redundant layout code for tabitem by using <include> however <include> only overwrite layout based attributes. Based on the [tabitem documentation.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/38035415/11200630), 3 attributes are provided for TabItem and they can be used alongside with the layout declaration.
